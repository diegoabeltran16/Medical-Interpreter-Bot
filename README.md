# Medical Interpreter Discord Bot
Espa√±ol - English

## Description
The Medical Interpreter Discord Bot is designed to assist medical interpreters by providing and organizing commonly used medical terms across various specialties. It supports real-time queries, allows for the easy addition of new terms, and provides relevant terms and definitions based on user input without requiring explicit commands.

### Scope
Develop a smart Discord bot designed to assist medical interpreters by providing and organizing commonly used medical terms in specific specialties. The bot will support real-time queries, allow for the easy addition of new terms, and provide relevant terms and definitions based on user input without requiring explicit commands.

### Objectives
- Enable quick and intuitive access to medical terms for interpreters during consultations.
- Automatically analyze and organize new information provided by users.
- Provide specialty-specific term lists.
- Allow for easy expansion and updates to the database.
- Ensure the bot is user-friendly and accessible.
- Incorporate best programming practices for maintainability and scalability.

##### Architecture

**Components**
* Discord Bot: Handles user interactions and commands, with NLU capabilities.
* Database: Stores medical terms and their definitions.
* NLU Model: Recognizes and organizes terms based on user input.
* Automation Scripts: Schedule regular updates and maintenance tasks.

###### Best Practices for Programming

**Project Organization:**
- Maintain a clear and consistent directory structure.
- Use version control (Git) and maintain a clear commit history.

**Coding Standards:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide.
- Use linters like flake8 or pylint to enforce coding standards.
- Document modules, classes, and functions with clear docstrings.
- Write modular code with single responsibility principles.

**Error Handling and Logging:**
- Implement robust error handling with try-except blocks.
- Use the logging module for logging events and errors.
- Configure logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

**Database Management:**
- Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) like SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- Ensure data integrity with clear schemas and constraints.
- Validate inputs to prevent inconsistent data.

**NLU Model:**
- Choose appropriate NLP tools (spaCy, NLTK, transformers) for natural language understanding.
- Train the model with a diverse and representative dataset.
- Evaluate model performance with cross-validation and other metrics.
- Regularly retrain the model with new data.

**Automation and Scheduling:**
- Use the schedule library for automated updates and maintenance.
- Handle network issues and partial failures gracefully in automation scripts.

**Security Best Practices:**
- Store sensitive information in environment variables using a .env file.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

**Testing and Deployment:**
- Write unit tests using unittest or pytest.
- Aim for high test coverage.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) for automated testing and deployment.

**User Experience:**
- Design intuitive and consistent interactions.
- Provide clear and concise responses.
- Collect user feedback and incorporate it into improvements.
