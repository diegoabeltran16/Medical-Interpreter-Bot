## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Libraries: discord.py, SQLite, pandas, scikit-learn, schedule, spaCy/NLTK, transformers, dotenv
* Discord bot token
* Version control with Git

### Functional Requirements
* NLU capabilities to recognize terms and context without explicit commands.
* User input analysis to identify new terms and their definitions.
* Automated database updates.
* Specialty prediction based on term definitions.

### Non-Functional Requirements
* User-friendly and intuitive interface.
* Secure data handling and storage.
* Scalable architecture for future enhancements.
* Compliance with coding standards and best practices.

## Architecture

### Components
* Discord Bot: Handles user interactions and commands, with NLU capabilities.
* Database: Stores medical terms and their definitions.
* NLU Model: Recognizes and organizes terms based on user input.
* Automation Scripts: Schedule regular updates and maintenance tasks.

### Flow
1. **User Input:** User sends a message to the bot.
2. **Bot Processing:** Bot processes the message, recognizes terms, and interacts with the database.
3. **Response:** Bot retrieves relevant information and responds to the user.
4. **Automation:** Scheduled tasks update the database with new terms.

## Wireframes

**Discord Chat Interface:**
A simple text-based interface with natural language input and bot responses.

**Interaction Example:**
User: "I am in a cardiology consultation. Can you give me some general terms?"
Bot: "Common terms in Cardiology: Arrhythmia: An irregular heartbeat. Bradycardia: A slower than normal heart rate. Myocardial Infarction: A heart attack."
User: "I just came across a term: Tachycardia. It means a faster than normal heart rate."
Bot: "Got it. 'Tachycardia' has been added to Cardiology."

### Database Management
* Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) like SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
* Ensure data integrity with clear schemas and constraints.
* Validate inputs to prevent inconsistent data.

### NLU Model
* Choose appropriate NLP tools (spaCy, NLTK, transformers) for natural language understanding.
* Train the model with a diverse and representative dataset.
* Evaluate model performance with cross-validation and other metrics.
* Regularly retrain the model with new data.

### Automation and Scheduling
