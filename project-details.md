## Git

- **sync_repos.sh:** Use for full repository syncs.
- **sync_branch.sh:** Use for syncing individual branches.
- **sync_feature.sh:** (Optional) Use for syncing all feature branches.
- **sync_hotfix.sh:** (Optional) Use for syncing all hotfix branches.

The provided scripts incorporate good practices, including error handling, debugging output, and clear messaging. 

**sync_repos.sh:** 
-Purpose: Orchestrates the syncing of all branches listed in the script.
-Use Case: Run this script when you want to perform a full sync of all relevant branches (main, develop, feature branches, etc.) between GitHub and GitLab.
-Frequency: Use this regularly, such as at the end of each development cycle or before major releases.
-Command:

```
sync_repos.sh

```

**sync_branch.sh:**
-Purpose: Syncs a single specified branch.
-Use Case: Use this script when you need to sync a specific branch, for example, if you’ve made changes to one particular branch and want to ensure it’s up-to-date across both repositories.
-Frequency: Use as needed, particularly when working on or updating specific branches.
-Command

```
sync_branch.sh <branch-name>

Ej. sync_branch.sh feature/add-new-functionality

```

**sync_feature.sh:**
-Purpose: Syncs all feature branches.
-Use Case: Use this script when you want to focus on syncing all feature branches separately from main and develop branches.
-Frequency: Use this periodically, especially during active feature development.
-Command

```
sync_feature.sh

```

**sync_hotfix.sh:**
Purpose: Syncs all hotfix branches.
Use Case: Use this script when you want to ensure hotfix branches are quickly synced due to their critical nature.
Frequency: Use this immediately after creating or updating a hotfix branch to ensure critical fixes are applied across both repositories.
-Command

```
sync_hotfix.sh

```

**Advantages of Using Separate Scripts**
- Modularity: Each script handles a specific task, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- Reusability: You can reuse the sync_branch.sh script independently if you need to sync a specific branch manually.
- Easier Debugging: When issues arise, it's easier to identify and fix problems within a smaller, focused script.
